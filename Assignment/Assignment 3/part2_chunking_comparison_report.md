## Observations

### Performance Analysis

**Token-based Chunking**:
- Provides consistent chunk sizes, ensuring predictable retrieval behavior
- May split sentences mid-way, potentially losing semantic coherence
- Fast processing due to simple token counting

**Semantic Chunking**:
- Creates semantically coherent chunks by identifying natural boundaries
- May produce variable chunk sizes, potentially affecting retrieval consistency
- Slower processing due to embedding computation for boundary detection

**Sentence-window Chunking**:
- Preserves sentence integrity while maintaining surrounding context
- Balances semantic coherence with consistent retrieval units
- Moderate processing speed with good context preservation

## Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive analysis of the three chunking techniques on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset:

1. **For semantic coherence**: Semantic chunking performs best as it identifies natural
   boundaries in the text, creating more meaningful chunks for retrieval.

2. **For balanced performance**: Sentence-window chunking offers the best compromise,
   maintaining sentence integrity while providing sufficient context through windowing.

3. **For consistency**: Token-based chunking provides the most predictable chunk sizes
   but may sacrifice semantic coherence for uniform processing.

**Recommendation**: For retrieval-focused RAG applications on literary texts like Shakespeare,
sentence-window chunking is recommended as it balances semantic coherence, context preservation,
and retrieval consistency effectively.
